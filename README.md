## API Description

The Browse API has the following resources: item_summary: Lets shoppers search for specific items by keyword, GTIN, category, charity, product, or item aspects and refine the results by using filters. &nbsp;(Experimental) search_by_image: Lets shoppers search for specific items by image. You can refine the results by using URI parameters and filters. item: Lets you retrieve the details of a specific item or all the items in an item group, which is an item with variations such as color and size. Lets you check if a product is compatible with the specified item, such as if a specific car is compatible with a specific part. Provides a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Trading and Finding, and the RESTful APIs, such as Browse, which use different formats for the item IDs enabling you to retrieve the details of the item and the RESTful item ID using a legacy item ID. &nbsp;(Experimental) shopping_cart: Provides the ability for eBay members to see the contents of their eBay cart, and add, remove, and change the quantity of items in their eBay cart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: This resource is not available in the eBay API Explorer. The item_summary, search_by_image, and item resource calls require an Application access token. The shopping_cart resource calls require a User access token.

## Authorization

Supported authorization schemes:
- OAuth2
- OAuth2

For OAuth 2.0 you need to specify OAuth Client credentials as environment variables in the connector repository:
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - your OAuth client id
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - your OAuth client secret

## Actions

### This method is a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Trading, Shopping, and Finding and the eBay Buy APIs. There are differences between how legacy APIs and RESTful APIs return the identifier of an &quot;item&quot;. There is also a difference in what the item ID represents and in the format of the item ID value returned. This method lets you use the legacy item IDs retrieve the details of a specific item, such as description, price, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. It also returns the RESTful item ID, which you can use with all the Buy API methods. For more information about how to use legacy IDs with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide. This method returns the item details and requires you to pass in either the item ID of a non-variation item or the item IDs of both the parent and child of an item group. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the &quot;parent&quot;. All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc. The fieldgroups URI parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item. For more information, see fieldgroups. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/get_item_by_legacy_id/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/get_item_by_legacy_id/ Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this method. This header enables eBay Network Partners to pass in their identification in order to be paid for selling eBay items and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improve the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buying Integration Guide. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.

*Tags:* `item`

#### Input Parameters
* `fieldgroups` - _optional_ - This field lets you control what is returned in the response. If you do not set this field, the method returns all the details of the item. Note: In this method, the only value supported is PRODUCT. Valid values: PRODUCT - This adds the additionalImages, additionalProductIdentities, aspectGroups, description, gtins, image, and title fields to the response, which describe the item's product. See Product for more information about these fields.
* `legacy_item_id` - _required_ - Specifies either: The legacy item ID of an item that is not part of a group. The legacy item ID of a group, which is the ID of the &quot;parent&quot; of the group of items. Note: If you pass in a group ID, you must also use the legacy_variation_id field and pass in the legacy ID of the specific item variation (child ID). Legacy IDs are returned by eBay traditional APIs, such as the Trading API or Finding API. The following is an example of using the value of the ItemID field for a specific item from Trading to get the RESTful itemId value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; browse/v1/item/get_item_by_legacy_id?legacy_item_id=110039490209 Maximum: 1
* `legacy_variation_id` - _optional_ - Specifies the legacy item ID of a specific item in an item group, such as the red shirt size L. Legacy IDs are returned by eBay traditional APIs, such as the Trading API or Finding API. Maximum: 1 Requirement: You must always pass in the legacy_item_id with the legacy_variation_id
* `legacy_variation_sku` - _optional_ - Specifics the legacy SKU of the item. SKU are item IDs created by the seller. Legacy SKUs are returned by eBay traditional APIs, such as the Trading API or Finding API. The following is an example of using the value of the ItemID and SKU fields, which were returned by the Trading API, to get the RESTful itemId value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; browse/v1/item/get_item_by_legacy_id?legacy_item_id=110039490209&amp;legacy_variation_sku=V-00031-WHM Maximum: 1 Requirement: You must always pass in the legacy_item_id with the legacy_variation_sku

### This method retrieves the details of the individual items in an item group. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. You pass in the item group ID as a URI parameter. You use this method to show the item details of items with multiple aspects, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. This method returns two main containers; items and commonDescriptions. The items container has an array of containers with the details of each item in the group. The commonDescriptions container has an array of containers for a description and the item IDs of all the items that have this exact description. Because items within an item group often have the same description, this decreases the size of the response. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/get_items_by_item_group/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/get_items_by_item_group/ Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this method. This header enables eBay Network Partners to pass in their identification in order to be paid for selling eBay items and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improve the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buying Integration Guide. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.

*Tags:* `item`

#### Input Parameters
* `item_group_id` - _required_ - Identifier of the item group to return. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. This ID is returned in the itemGroupHref field of the search and getItem methods. For Example: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/get_items_by_item_group?item_group_id=351825690866

### This method retrieves the details of a specific item, such as description, price, category, all item aspects, condition, return policies, seller feedback and score, shipping options, shipping costs, estimated delivery, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. Note: This method will return FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items and AUCTION items where no bids have been placed. But after a bid has been placed, that item becomes an active auction item and is no longer returned. The Buy APIs are designed to let you create an eBay shopping experience in your app or website. This means you will need to know when something, such as the availability, quantity, etc., has changed in any eBay item you are offering. You can do this easily by setting the fieldgroups URI parameter. This parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting fieldgroups to COMPACT reduces the response to only the five fields that you need in order to check if any item detail has changed. Setting fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item. You can use either COMPACT or PRODUCT but not both. For more information, see fieldgroups. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/ Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this method. This header enables eBay Network Partners to pass in their identification in order to be paid for selling eBay items and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improve the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buying Integration Guide. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.

*Tags:* `item`

#### Input Parameters
* `fieldgroups` - _optional_ - This parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. If you do not set this field, the method returns all the details of the item. Valid values: PRODUCT - This adds the additionalImages, additionalProductIdentities, aspectGroups, description, gtins, image, and title product fields to the response, which describe the product associated with the item. See Product for more information about these fields. COMPACT - This returns only the following fields, which let you quickly check if the availability or price of the item has changed, if the item has been revised by the seller, or if an item's top-rated plus status has changed for items you have stored. itemId - The identifier of the item. sellerItemRevision - An identifier generated/incremented when a seller revises the item. There are two types of item revisions; seller changes, such as changing the title, and eBay system changes, such as changing the quantity when an item is purchased. This ID is changed only when the seller makes a change to the item. This means you cannot use this value to determine if the quantity has changed. topRatedBuyingExperience - A boolean value indicating if this item is a top-rated plus item. A change in the item's top rated plus standing is not tracked by the revision ID. See topRatedBuyingExperience for more information. price - This is tracked by the revision ID but is returned here to enable you to quickly verify the price of the item. estimatedAvailabilities - Returns the item availability information, which is based on the item's quantity. Changes in quantity are not tracked by the revision ID. For Example To check if a stored item's information is current, do following. Pass in the item ID and set fieldgroups to COMPACT. item/v1|46566502948|0?fieldgroups=COMPACT Do one of the following: If the sellerItemRevision field is returned and you haven't stored a revision number for this item, record the number and pass in the item ID in the getItem method to get the latest information. If the revision number is different from the value you have stored, update the value and pass in the item ID in the getItem method to get the latest information. If the sellerItemRevision field is not returned or has not changed, where needed, update the item information with the information returned in the response. Maximum value: 1 If more than one values is specified, the first value will be used.
* `item_id` - _required_ - The eBay RESTful identifier of an item. This ID is returned by the Browse and Feed API methods. RESTful Item ID Format: v1|#|# For example: v1|272394640372|0 or v1|162846450672|461882996982 For more information about item ID for RESTful APIs, see the Legacy API compatibility section of the Buy APIs Overview.

### This method checks if a product is compatible with the specified item. You can use this method to check the compatibility of cars, trucks, and motorcycles with a specific part listed on eBay. For example, to check the compatibility of a part, you pass in the item ID of the part as a URI parameter and specify all the attributes used to define a specific car in the compatibilityProperties container. If the call is successful, the response will be COMPATIBLE, NOT_COMPATIBLE, or UNDETERMINED. See compatibilityStatus for details. To find the attributes and values for a specific marketplace, you can use the compatibility methods in the Taxonomy API. You can use this data to create menus to help buyers specify the product, such as their car. The following table lists the required attributes for the US marketplace that describe motor vechiles. Required compatibilityProperties Attributes (US Marketplace) Cars and Trucks Motorcycles Year Make Model Trim Engine Year Make Model Submodel&nbsp;&nbsp; For an example, see the Samples section. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/ Note: This method is supported only on Production. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.

*Tags:* `item`

#### Input Parameters
* `item_id` - _required_ - The eBay RESTful identifier of an item (such as a part you want to check). This ID is returned by the Browse and Feed API methods. RESTful Item ID Format: v1|#|# For example: v1|272394640372|0 or v1|162846450672|461882996982 For more information about item ID for RESTful APIs, see the Legacy API compatibility section of the Buy APIs Overview.
* `X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID` - _required_ - The ID of the eBay marketplace you want to use. Note: This value is case sensitive. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID = EBAY_US For a list of supported sites see, API Restrictions.

### This method searches for eBay items by various query parameters and retrieves summaries of the items. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, charity ID, or a combination of these. Note: Only FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items are returned. However, the method does return items where both FIXED_PRICE and AUCTION are available as a buying option. But after a bid has been placed, that item becomes an active auction item and is no longer returned. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item , such as item aspects (color, brand), condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter. Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter. Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/ Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this method. This header enables eBay Network Partners to pass in their identification in order to be paid for selling eBay items and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improve the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buying Integration Guide. Restrictions This method can return a maximum of 10,000 items. For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.

*Tags:* `item_summary`

#### Input Parameters
* `aspect_filter` - _optional_ - This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. For example, the method below uses the category ID for Women's Clothing. This will return only items for a woman's red shirt. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;category_ids=15724&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red} To get a list of the aspects pairs and the category, which is returned in the dominantCategoryId field, set fieldgroups to ASPECT_REFINEMENTS. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Required: The category ID is required twice; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/browse/types/AspectFilter.html
* `category_ids` - _optional_ - The category ID is used to limit the results. This field can have one category ID or a comma separated list of IDs. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?category_ids=29792 Note: Currently, you can pass in only one category ID. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids, epid, and q fields. This gives you additional control over the result set. For example, let's say you are looking of a toy phone. If you search for &quot;phone&quot;, the result set will be mobile phones because this is the &quot;Best Match&quot; for this search. But if you also include the toy category ID, the results will be what you wanted. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=220 The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site: Use the Category Changes page. Use the Taxonomy API. For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs. Submit the following method to get the dominantCategoryId for an item. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=keyword&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Note: If a top-level (L1) category is specified, you must also include the q query parameter. Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)
* `charity_ids` - _optional_ - The charity ID is used to limit the results to only items associated with the specified charity. This field can have one charity ID or a comma separated list of IDs. The method will return all the items associated with the specified charities. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?charity_ids=13-1788491,300108469 The charity ID is the charity's registration ID, also known as the Employer Identification Number (EIN). In GB, it is the Charity Registration Number (CRN), commonly called &quot;Charity Number&quot;. To find the charities eBay supports, you can search for a charity at Charity Search or go to Charity Shop. To find the charity ID of a specific charity, click on a charity and use the EIN number. For example, the charity ID for American Red Cross, is 530196605. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids and q fields with a charity_Ids to filter the result set. This gives you additional control over the result set. Restriction: This is supported only on the US and GB marketplaces. Maximum: 20 IDs Required: One ID
* `epid` - _optional_ - The ePID is the eBay product identifier of a product from the eBay product catalog. This field limits the results to only items in the specified ePID. The Marketing API getMerchandisedProducts method and the Browse API getItem, getItemByLegacyId, and getItemsByItemGroup calls return the ePID of the product. You can also use the product_summary/search method in the Catalog API to search for the ePID of the product. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?epid=15032 Maximum: 1 Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)
* `fieldgroups` - _optional_ - This field is a comma separated list of values that lets you control what is returned in the response. The default is MATCHING_ITEMS, which returns the items that match the keyword or category specified. The other values return data that can be used to create histograms or provide additional information. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - This returns the aspectDistributions container, which has the dominantCategoryId, matchCount, and refinementHref for the various aspects of the items found. For example, if you searched for 'Mustang', some of the aspect would be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, etc. Note: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS are category specific. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the buyingOptionDistributions container, which has the matchCount and refinementHref for AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items. Note: Classified items are not supported and only &quot;Buy It Now&quot; (non-auction) items are returned. CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - This returns the categoryDistributions container, which has the categories that the item is in. CONDITION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the conditionDistributions container, such as NEW, USED, etc. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition. For example, New can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc. EXTENDED - Returns the shortDescription field, which provides condition and item aspect information and the itemLocation.city field. MATCHING_ITEMS - This is meant to be used with one or more of the refinement values above. You use this to return the specified refinements and all the matching items. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_ITEMS
* `filter` - _optional_ - This field supports multiple field filters that can be used to limit/customize the result set. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;filter=price:[10..50] You can also combine filters. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;filter=price:[10..50],sellers:{rpseller|bigSal} The following are the supported filters.

* `gtin` - _optional_ - This field lets you search by the Global Trade Item Number of the item as defined by http://www.gtin.info. This can be a UPC (Universal Product Code), EAN (European Article Number), or an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) value. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?gtin=099482432621 Maximum: 1 Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)
* `limit` - _optional_ - The number of items, from the result set, returned in a single page. Default: 50 Maximum number of items per page (limit): 200 Maximum number of items in a result set: 10,000
* `offset` - _optional_ - Specifies the number of items to skip in the result set. This is used with the limit field to control the pagination of the output. If offset is 0 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 1-10 from the list of items returned, if offset is 10 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 11 thru 20 from the list of items returned. Valid Values: 0-10,000 (inclusive) Default: 0 Maximum number of items returned: 10,000
* `q` - _optional_ - A string consisting of one or more keywords that are used to search for items on eBay. The keywords are handled as follows: If the keywords are separated by a comma, it is treated as an AND. In the following example, the query returns items that have iphone AND ipad. /buy/browse/v1_beta/item_summary/search?q=iphone,ipad If the keywords are separated by a space, it is treated as an OR. In the following examples, the query returns items that have iphone OR ipad. /buy/browse/v1_beta/item_summary/search?q=iphone&nbsp;ipad /buy/browse/v1_beta/item_summary/search?q=iphone,&nbsp;ipad Restriction: The * wildcard character is not allowed in this field. Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)
* `sort` - _optional_ - Specifies the order and the field name to use to sort the items. To sort in descending order use - before the field name. Currently, you can only sort by price (in ascending or descending order), or by distance (only applicable if the &quot;pickup&quot; filters are used, and only ascending order is supported). If no sort parameter is submitted, the result set is sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. The following are examples of using the sort query parameter. Sort Result sort=price Sorts by price in ascending order (lowest price first) sort=-price Sorts by price in descending order (highest price first) sort=distance Sorts by distance in ascending order (shortest distance first) Default: ascending For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/browse/types/SortField.html

### This is an Experimental method. This method searches for eBay items based on a image and retrieves summaries of the items. You pass in a Base64 image in the request payload and can refine the search by category, or eBay product ID (ePID), or a combination of these using URI parameters. To get the Base64 image string, you can use sites such as https://codebeautify.org/image-to-base64-converter. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more.

### This is an experimental method. This method retrieves all the items in the eBay member's cart; items added to the cart while on ebay.com as well as items added to the cart using the Browse API. There are no URI parameters or request payload.

### This is an Experimental method. This method creates an eBay cart for the eBay member, if one does not exist, and adds items to that cart. Because a cart never expires, any item added to the cart will remain in the cart until it is removed. To use this method, you must submit a RESTful item ID and the quantity of the item. If the quantity value is greater than the number of available, the quantity value is changed to the number available and a warning is returned. For example, if there are 15 baseballs available and you set the quantity value to 50, the service automatically changes the value of quantity to 15. The response returns all the items in the eBay member's cart; items added to the cart while on ebay.com as well as items added to the cart using the Browse API. The quantity and state of an item changes often. If the item becomes &quot;unavailable&quot; such as, when the listing has ended or the item is out of stock, whether it has just been added to the cart or has been in the cart for some time, the item will be returned in the unavailableCartItems container. Note: There are differences between how legacy APIs, such as Trading and Finding, and RESTful APIs, such as Browse, return the identifier of an &quot;item&quot;. There is also a difference in what the item ID represents and in the format of the item ID value returned. If you have an item ID from one of the legacy APIs, you can use the legacy item ID with the getItemByLegacyId method to retrieve the RESTful ID for that item. For more information about how to use legacy IDs with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide.

### This is an experimental method. This method removes a specific item from the eBay member's cart. You specify the ID of the item in the cart (cartItemId) that you want to remove. The response returns all the items in the eBay member's cart; items added to the cart while on ebay.com as well as items added to the cart using the Browse API. If you remove the last item in the cart, the response is HTTP 204. The quantity and state of an item changes often. If the item becomes &quot;unavailable&quot; such as, when the listing has ended or the item is out of stock, the item will be returned in the unavailableCartItems container. Note: The cartItemId is not the same as the item ID. The cartItemId is the identifier of a specific item in the cart and is generated when the item was added to the cart.
